  "bio": "I'm a software developer driven by my love for tech and how it works. I'm mostly writing frontend for web applications with React and Redux, but I am comfortable writing Node JS on the backend as well. I am hardly very opinionated and very open to trying out new tools/languages if you can convince me. I have got a fair amount of knowledge testing large scale software applications too. Finally, everything is better in dark mode :)",
